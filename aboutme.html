<h2>About Me</h2>
<p style="font-size:125%;">I am a 16 year old highschool sophomore at Francis Polytechnic High School. I love math and science, and my hobbies include drawing, watching TV shows, and colorguard. One thing a lot of people don't know about me is that I can juggle 3 things.</p>

<p> Some of the similarities between scratch and python are the loops and the basic movement commands. The format is also similar in that the code is contained within the loop. They are different in format in that scratch uses visual blocks while python uses text.
 
Debugging the program felt frustrating. It was harder than scratch. But I liked that I was able to debug anyway. The hardest part was catching typos. Mistakes in the code are more prone to happen as there are more opportunities being that you actually have to type out the code in python..
